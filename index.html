		<p>Montana is a state in the Mountain region of the Western United States.

It is the fourth-largest state by area, the eighth-least populous state, and the third-least densely populated state. Its capital is Helena, while the largest city is Billings. The state's topography is roughly defined by the Continental Divide, which splits much of the state into distinct eastern and western regions.Most of Montana's hundred or more named mountain ranges are in the state's western half, most of which is geologically and geographically part of the northern Rocky Mountains.</p>

		<h2>Religion</h2>

			<p>According to the Pew Research Center in 2014, the religious affiliations of the people of Montana were predominantly Christian; in the state, Christianity was 65% of the total adult population. At the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute's (PRRI) study, 57% of the adult population were Christian. While Catholicism was the largest single Christian group in the state, mainline and evangelical Protestantism dominated the Christian landscape collectively. By the Public Religion Research Institute's 2022 survey, Christianity grew to 62% of the population altogether, with 43% Protestant, 17% Catholic, and 2% Restorationist through Mormonism.</p>
		
		<h2>Health</h2>

			<p>Montana has a Trauma I hospital in Billings and Trauma II hospitals in Missoula and Great Falls. In 2013, AARP The Magazine named the Billings Clinic one of the safest hospitals in the United States.</p>
		
			<p>Montana had a suicide rate of 26.1 per 100,000 in 2020, which is the 3rd-highest among U.S. states; high suicide rates are common among sparsely-populated states in the United States.</p>
		
		<h2>Politics</h2>

			<p>Elections in the state have been historically competitive, particularly for state-level offices. The Democratic Party's strength in the state is gained from support among unionized miners and railroad workers, while farmers generally vote Republican.</p>

			<p>Montana has a history of voters splitting their tickets and filling elected offices with individuals from both parties. Through the mid-20th century, the state had a tradition of "sending the liberals to Washington and the conservatives to Helena". Between 1988 and 2006, the pattern flipped, with voters more likely to elect conservatives to federal offices.</p>
